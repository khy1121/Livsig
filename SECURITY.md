## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

**Note on Database Security:**
All database-related configuration, credentials, and sensitive connection details are strictly managed via environment variables (`.env`). The `.env` file is excluded from version control to prevent data leaks.
